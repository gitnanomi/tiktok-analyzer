CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES - FOLLOW EXACTLY:
- NEVER use asterisks, stars, or any markdown symbols
- Use only bullet points with the "â€¢" character (ALT+0149)
- Use numbered lists with plain numbers: 1. 2. 3.
- NO bold, italic, or any special formatting
- Be EXTREMELY specific - no vague statements

Video: "${video.title || video.description}" by @${video.author}

Provide TWO versions for each section: SUMMARY (bullets) and DETAILED (full analysis)

---

HOOK (First 3 Seconds)

SUMMARY:
- [Exact visual action in first frame - be specific: "camera zooms into product on marble counter" not "shows product"]
- [Exact audio/text in first 3 seconds - quote it or describe precisely]
- [Specific emotion triggered - not just "curiosity" but "FOMO about missing a life hack"]
- [Why this specific pattern interrupt works for this audience]

DETAILED:
[Write 4-5 sentences with EXTREME specificity. Describe: exact camera movement, exact framing (close-up/medium/wide), what the creator is wearing if visible, background elements, lighting quality (harsh/soft/natural), exact facial expression, hand gestures, props visible, and the psychological trigger being activated. Example level of detail: "Opens with a tight close-up of the creator's face filling 80% of frame, natural window lighting from camera left creating soft shadows, wearing a casual gray hoodie, direct eye contact with camera, raises one eyebrow while asking 'Why is nobody talking about this?' The question format plus eyebrow raise triggers pattern interrupt and creates information gap."]

---

STORY LINE

SUMMARY:
- [Specific narrative structure used - not "builds tension" but "uses before/after contrast structure"]
- [Exact pain point shown - be concrete: "shows struggling to wake up at 5am for 3 days straight"]
- [How creator maintains engagement - specific technique like "rapid 2-second cuts between scenes"]
- [Emotional journey arc - from X feeling to Y feeling with specific moments]

DETAILED:
[Write 4-5 sentences analyzing the story structure with precision. Break down the exact sequence of events, timing of each segment, how the creator transitions between points, specific examples of relatability moments, exact editing techniques used (jump cuts/transitions/overlays), pacing analysis (fast/medium/slow and where), and how each segment connects to the next. Be so specific that someone could recreate the narrative structure.]

---

SCRIPTING PROCESS

SUMMARY:
- IDEA VALIDATION: [How this specific idea was likely validated - what makes it logically sound and watch-worthy]
- HOOK CONSTRUCTION: [Specific visual and verbal elements engineered for first 3 seconds]
- LAST LINE PLANNING: [What ending moment was planned - the specific reaction, statement, or reveal]
- FORESHADOWING: [Exact promise or expectation set after the hook - quote it]
- ROUGH SCRIPT: [Key bullet points likely planned before filming - list 3-4 specific beats]
- FILMING: [Specific shooting approach - single take vs multiple angles, location choices, props needed]
- EDITING: [Key editing decisions - cut frequency, effects used, pacing choices]

DETAILED:
[Write 6-8 sentences doing a deep reverse-engineering of how this video was planned using the backwards-scripting method. Start with analyzing what made this idea worth pursuing. Then detail exactly how the hook was constructed to be visual-first and simple. Explain what the planned ending was and why ending there maximizes retention. Describe the specific foreshadowing technique used (verbal promise, text overlay, visual preview). Break down the likely bullet points in the rough script before filming. Analyze the filming execution - was this one continuous take or multiple setups, what equipment was likely used. Finally, detail the editing choices that support the hook-to-ending structure. Be extremely specific about timing, cuts, and flow.]

---

CALL TO ACTION (CTA)

SUMMARY:
- [Specific action requested - not "engagement" but "comment your experience" or "click link"]
- [Exact placement and delivery method - when and how in the video]
- [Implicit vs explicit approach used]

DETAILED:
[Write 3-4 sentences describing the exact CTA strategy. Where in the video does it appear (timestamp if possible), what are the exact words used, is it verbal/text/both, what makes this CTA compelling for this specific content, and what friction points are removed to increase conversion.]

---

VISUAL ELEMENTS

SUMMARY:
- CAMERA: [Specific camera work - "handheld selfie style with slight movement" not just "selfie"]
- FRAMING: [Exact composition - "rule of thirds with subject on right third, product left"]
- LIGHTING: [Precise lighting description - "soft natural window light, 2700K warm tone, no harsh shadows"]
- EDITING: [Specific edit style - "1.5 second average shot length, hard cuts, no transitions"]
- TEXT/GRAPHICS: [Exact overlay details - "yellow sans-serif captions, bottom third, 3-word max per screen"]

DETAILED:
[Write 5-6 sentences with technical precision about production. Describe exact camera angles (overhead/eye-level/low), specific framing choices and why they work, detailed lighting setup (direction, quality, color temperature), editing rhythm with specific timing, text overlay specs (font style, color, animation, placement), any special effects or filters, color grading choices, and how these technical decisions support the content strategy. Be so detailed that a video editor could replicate the look.]

---

SUCCESS FACTORS

List EXACTLY 3 specific reasons with deep explanation:

1. ALGORITHM FACTOR: [Specific algorithmic element this video optimizes - e.g., "Watch time optimization through abrupt ending keeps AVD above 85%"]

2. PSYCHOLOGY FACTOR: [Specific psychological principle exploited - e.g., "Uses social proof by showing 10 people failing before revealing the solution, triggering bandwagon effect"]

3. EXECUTION FACTOR: [Specific production or delivery element - e.g., "Rapid-fire pacing with 2-second shot average matches audience attention span and prevents scroll"]

---

REPLICABLE ELEMENTS

List EXACTLY 3 tactical elements with implementation details:

1. [Specific tactic with exact how-to - e.g., "Open with a question that challenges common belief: film in one take, direct eye contact, pause 0.5 seconds after question for emphasis"]

2. [Second specific tactic - must include exact execution method]

3. [Third specific tactic - must be immediately actionable]

---

METADATA

CONTENT TYPE: [One word: UGC-style / Faceless / Professional / Hybrid]
CATEGORY: [One word: Tutorial / Review / Challenge / Vlog / Entertainment / Educational / Story]
TONE: [One word: High-Energy / Calm / Emotional / Humorous / Educational / Inspirational]
IS AD: [Yes or No] - [If yes, what product and integration method]

---

AI PROMPT ENGINEERING

MIDJOURNEY PROMPT:
[Write a 60-80 word detailed prompt with ZERO brackets or placeholders. Include: exact subject description, specific environment/setting with details, precise lighting description (direction, quality, color temp), exact camera angle and framing, specific mood/atmosphere, style references, technical specs like "shot on iPhone 14 Pro", color grading notes, depth of field specs. Make it copy-paste ready. Example quality: "Close-up product shot of amber glass serum bottle on white marble bathroom counter, soft diffused morning light from left window creating gentle shadows, overhead 45-degree angle showing product label clearly, clean minimalist spa aesthetic, shot on iPhone 14 Pro in portrait mode, 3000K warm lighting, f/2.8 aperture creating subtle background blur, professional commercial photography style, high-end skincare editorial look"]

ALGORITHM FACTOR: Abrupt ending at 15-second mark keeps average view duration above 92%, maximizing completion rate which TikTok algorithm prioritizes heavily, plus comment section incompleteness drives engagement signals\n\n2. PSYCHOLOGY FACTOR: Leverages social proof through visual demonstration of real results rather than claims, activating mirror neurons as viewers mentally experience the transformation, combined with relatable pain point (morning struggle) creating instant connection with 80%+ of target demographic\n\n3. EXECUTION FACTOR: Perfect balance of authenticity (UGC shooting style, natural lighting, handheld camera) with strategic production (2-second cut rhythm matching attention span, rule of thirds framing, strategic product placement), making it feel genuine while delivering clear value proposition',
        replicableElements: '1. SURPRISE-QUESTION HOOK: Film in one continuous take, hold product at eye level filling 25-30% of frame, make direct eye contact, raise eyebrows naturally, deliver question with rising vocal inflection on last word, pause 0.3 seconds after question before cut for emphasis\n\n2. THREE-DAY MONTAGE STRUCTURE: Shoot same scenario across 3 consecutive days wearing same outfit, keep each clip exactly 2 seconds, use hard jump cuts between days, maintain consistent camera angle and lighting for cohesive feel, compress time visually while text overlay shows progression\n\n3. ABRUPT HIGH-ENERGY ENDING: Plan your final frame to be peak emotional moment (excitement/relief/surprise), cut immediately after that moment without wind-down or transition, hold final frame exactly 0.5 seconds showing product clearly before cut, resist urge to add outro or verbal CTA which reduces retention',
