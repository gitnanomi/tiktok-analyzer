## 💰 PRICING STRATEGY EXPLAINED

### 3-Tier Rationale:

**Starter ($19/mo):**

- Tests commitment
- Upsell path to Pro

**Pro ($49/mo) - ANCHOR PRICE:**
- Positioned as "best value"
- Most features included
- Monthly coaching = high perceived value
- Target: 70% of paid users

**Agency ($199/mo):**
- Makes Pro look affordable
- Actual target: 5-10% of users
- High margin for support cost

### Psychological Pricing:
- $49 (not $50) = perceived as $40s
